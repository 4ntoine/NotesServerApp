The `app-api` module exposes application interface - use cases and data structures (DTOs).
This is helpful even for non-developers (eg. managers) to have an idea on what's the data and application functions are.

Also it has gateway interface. Originally *Gateway* wording was used, but currently *Repository* wording is used more frequent
(though there is some difference). Using *Gateway* wording here.
